# 5.Conclusion and Discussion

### Pros:
- User-Friendly Interface, Easy to access and use
- Helps users see restaurant reviews and then find a suitable restaurant
- Help restaurant owners advertise their restaurants
- Users can rate restaurants based on many criteria
- Helps me better understand the structure and operation of a website
- Helps me gain design and construction experience for future website projects

### Cons:
- Can only search in English or Vietnamese
-There are a few missing functions such as:
 + Owner cannot respond to user reviews
-The code is not consistent with each other, leading to duplicate funcions and variations

### What I've Learned During the Development Process
- Working in groups, you should come up with a plan. Even though there was a plan, the members did not follow through and were late for the deadline, so I learned from experience and fined them if they were still late.

- You should have the general structure of the website before coding so that when merging the code there will be no errors

### Future Improvements
- Can integrate multiple AIs and authenticate users
- Login with facebook, google
